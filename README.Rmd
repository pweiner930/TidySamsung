Summary: the goal of this project is to take multiple tables of data and create a tidy output data set. 
 
This data was sourced from UCI HAR Data set: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

The high level steps in the data cleaning process:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Contents in this GitHub repo:
1. Codebook - README supplied from the data source describing the data sets and variables
2. run_analysis.R - code written to perform the steps listed above. Note this function expects that the working directory is set to the top level of the downloaded zip file.
3. Tidy_Samsung_Data.txt - the output of the R code
